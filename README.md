# Designer Ipsum

Designer Ipsum was a fun weekend project born from wanting to make a quick React app, as It had been a while since I had build anything in it.
Generally for I prefer Vue and Astro for front-end frameworks. This app would likely benefit from being statically generated as it is very simple and could benefit from the SEO improvements. To be honest, the app is simple enough it would likely be more than fine to build it in just HTML/CSS and Typescript.

## Running the app.
1. Clone this repository
2. CD into the project directory.
3. Install project dependencies (I used bun)
```
  bun i
```
4. Run the development server
```
  bun run dev
```
## TODO 
This is a short list of things I might end up doing with this project, especially if it starts to see any form of real traffic. None of this is garunteed though, as this was just a small sample React project.
- [ ] Fix text box on mobile.
- [ ] Statically generate the site for better SEO
- [ ] Increase the pool of possible words and phrases

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by other fun lorem ipsum generators, some of which I will link below.
